# Guidelines for contributing to this project

Any constructive contributions &ndash; bug reports, pull requests (code or documentation), suggestions for improvements, and more &ndash; are welcome.

## Discussions

Discussion is welcome by creating a new issue [in this repository](https://github.com/usgs-biolab/pymodelcat/issues). In this project, we are soliciting specific input from the broader community on the design criteria and overall concept of the experimental USGS Model Catalog and will solicit specific input using labeled groupings on topics of interest within the issues. 

## Conduct

Everyone is asked to read and respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/usgs-biolab/pymodelcat/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating directly in this project.

## How, what, and where to contribute

In this project, we are maintaining certain textual content associated with the experimental USGS Model Catalog as markdown files or other text documents within the repository and will solicit specific input on those documents to be tracked, reviewed, and commented on via pull requests. If you're not comfortable using Git and your own tools for editing those files, refer to the Using GitHub section below.

There is also a code component to this repository that contains a work in progress Python project that does certain parts of catalog building and maintaining. You are welcome to contribute to that as well by forking the code and submitting pull requests.

The examples folder contains Jupyter Notebooks with some of our developing thinking on the concept and examples for of functionality from the pymodelcat package. You are also welcome to contribute your own examples following this pattern.
