    "Note: This is a new version of a notebook that I originally worked up elsewhere. It now operates using the pymodelcat package that I started. I've changed up the documentation accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a [container](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e8de96182cee42d134687cc) for model items in ScienceBase that we can operate against, it opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities for \"robots\" to do some work for us. This notebook explores what we might be able to get from the web links added into the mix. Theoretically, those represent a wealth of meaty material to help flesh out the model catalog as a useful resource. We can write some code that can go do some gathering, and then decide if there is anything that we can consistently bring back in to flesh out the items. Because we're doing this in code and this whole thing is experimental, we can be reasonably safe in writing information back into ScienceBase for use and evaluation. We just need to keep track of the parts of ScienceBase Items where we want to \"cede control to the robots\" and the parts we want to manage in some other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different strategies for leveraging those links to get more information together. One interesting dynamic would be to simply index everything we find on subsequent landing pages and even spidering into the contents like any search engine. I've proposed in the past that ScienceBase could do this writ large, providing directed search engine functionality to go after linked content in meaningful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, I'm focusing on a couple ways of fishing for structured metadata. This little robot is essentially the machine we talk about when we say things about \"machine-readable\" metadata or other content. A couple of potential strategies occur to me:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content negotiation - Some web pages and applications accessible over HTTP enable content negotiation, which is a method for the requestor to negotiate the structure or substance of the content that is returned in a response. It can also do things like specify languages that content should be returned in. This is all based on what the server/application providing the content will actually support. You can't force the system to give you something it isn't prepared to deliver. Systems like ScienceBase and some other USGS platforms do support content negotiation with a couple different machine readable options, so it's worth trying to see what we might be able to use.\n",
    "* Structured metadata - There are a whole variety of ways that web systems have worked out to embed structured, machine-readable metadata within the HTML content delivered through web pages and web apps. Many of these coalesce around the schema.org set of content specifications to give us some degree of consistency to work from. One cool thing about these techniques is that they can be implemented right within the primary vehicle for web content delivery - the web page viewed by humans. Perhaps the coolest thing from a data science perspective is that the specifications and encoding methods really encourage explicit semantics (meaning we don't have to guess about what words mean), use of persistent identifiers and linking to associated registries (so we don't have to guess about disambiguating things), and linking between concepts that relate (so we can go after a wealth of information and tie it all together into a network/graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two, structured metadata probably offers us the most promise in terms of richness of content, consistency in resulting data, and overall ease of use. Unfortunately, the uptake of these methods in USGS is pretty abysmal, including in ScienceBase where we've not updated our use of schema.org metadata in 8 years or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last resort, we could fall back on painful web scraping methods where we essentially parse HTML content and try to extract useful information. These are painful, because every one would essentially be a mostly custom affair that is probably more trouble than its worth. I do show a small bit of that here just for demonstration purposes."

In looking through the links, however, and the information that does come back on some of them, we might need to do a little more work to better classify just what these links mean when it comes to using content from their pages in a meaningful way (more on that later). To give a sense of what's returned here, I output a couple of examples."

I can then go back and process that in different ways to pull out what I want to use, but for now, I'm only taking it this far to examine for possibilities.\n",

As I said above, structured metadata holds a lot more interest and potential. I'm only trying to see if there is some kind of JSON response as the simplest thing to deal with. With the requests package, I can add in an Accept header that will still give me text/html content to work with if my Accept header is not accepted. For now, I just use a try block to see if I can shove the JSON content into my data structure. It's crude, but effective for our immediate purpose.\n",
    "* For the structured metadata part, I've found the [extruct](https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct) package from the ScrapingHub folks to be one of the most reliable, but it doesn't deal with quite all of the derivations folks have employed on embedding structured metadata in web pages. In this instance, I just try for anything we can get to evaluate for use.\n",
    "* The final thing threw in here as something of a Hail Mary if a basic web page meta scraper. It parses HTML content using the Python BeautifulSoup package and returns the page title and any named meta tags with content. This can sometimes yield a reasonable description depending on a lot of factors. This is a really terrible way to try and go about things for any kind of consisency given the vagaries of content management systems, legacy content, and all kinds of factors. But it's some other stuff to look at. I put this into a function that could be built upon further if it turns out this is actually a reasonable source to think about. There are also some more robust alternatives to this like the ScrapingHub AutoExtract API that we could think about.\n",

There are all kinds of considerations in doing this kind of thing in terms of having our robots be polite web crawlers and not freaking system administrators out with too many \"weird\" requests and how to optimize this kind of thing to check back in routinely over time for updated information. We could certainly paralellize this in a number of ways from launching Lambdas on the cloud to multithreading, and that would pull together data nice and quick. For now, working the relatively small number of links through in a loop is fine for demonstration and evaluation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you are fiddling with this and want to see what things look like before trying every URL, add something like ```[:5]``` to the end of the \"unique_links\" list in the for loop to only run a handful of URLs through the process."

    "* Do any of the descriptions make sense to serve as an abstract for the concept of the model as cataloged, or are they for some specific aspect of the modeling system?\n",
    "* Does our initial notional way of type classifying web links (e.g., Model Reference Link) help us in determining what information we can use?\n",

The list of dictionaries could be put into a number of other data structures for further analysis, but I find it easy enough just to work with a little bit of list comprehension at this point. I created a little helper function that incorporates the basic logic on how to tease out the interesting bits to look at.\n",

This model was developed to simulate the regional hydrologic system in Tri-County area and continues to be used for planning and protection of area water supplies. Revised contributing area delineations in response to recent pumping conditions were needed for local wellhead protection area programs. The model was calibrated to water level observations for 2017 from well driller logs, average water levels for 2012-17 from active USGS observation wells, and estimated baseflow for 2012-16 from USGS streamgaging station measurements. The model was used to delineate 10- and 40-year contributing areas to selected wells in Lansing and East Lansing, Michigan. This USGS data release contains all of the input and output files for the MODFLOW and MODPATH simulations described in the associated model documentation report (https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20181133).',\n",

The BISECT model is a combination of the Tides and Inflows to the Mangrove Everglades (TIME) and Biscayne models of the western and eastern parts of south Florida including Everglades National Park, the southern Miami-Dade urban area, and the Biscayne Bay coast and simulates hydrodynamic surface-water flow and three-dimensional groundwater conditions dynamically for the period 1996–2004 by using the Flow and Transport in a Linked Overland/Aquifer Density-Dependent System (FTLOADDS) simulator. BISECT includes a number of parameter and algorithmic refinements that improve simulation results relative to the TIME and Biscayne models and represents the hydrologic system more explicitly, including (1) improved topographic representations, (2) refined Manning’s friction coefficients, (3) improved evapotranspiration computation through spatially variable albedo, (4) increased vertical aquifer discretization, and (5) extension of the western boundary farther offshore.\\n\\nSensitivity analyses demonstrate that simulated flows into Long Sound have a different pattern of response to tidal amplitude, wind, and frictional resistance changes than do other coastal streams in the model; flows at Broad River and Lostmans River are most sensitive to tidal amplitude, wind, and frictional resistance changes; and flow to the Everglades coastal streams is substantially affected by surface-water/groundwater interactions in the eastern urban areas. Insight into the hydrologic system came from scenario simulations that represent proposed management actions, such as grouting of the aquifer to prevent seepage from the wetlands and changes to water deliveries proposed by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), and projected sea-level rise. These scenario management changes are considered separately to isolate their specific effects and also in conjunction with sea-level rise. Scenario simulations show that (1) attempts to prevent seepage from the wetlands by grouting the aquifer along the L 31N levee produce minimal effects on surface-water levels; (2) the increased water deliveries proposed in the CERP redistribute flow to the northwestern coastal part of the study area with a minimal reduction to the southeast and a more substantial reduction in flows in the intervening coastal zones, mitigating some sea-level rise effects; (3) sea-level rise has a larger effect on the hydrology (water levels, flow, and salinity) than does CERP restoration; and (4) support for ecological models and hydrologic studies can be provided by applying BISECT to scenarios influenced by climatic and anthropogenic changes or by meteorological variability, such as extreme wet or dry periods.'}}],\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Biscayne and Southern Everglades Coastal Transport (BISECT) model was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey under the Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Studies Initiative to evaluate, both separately and in conjunction, the likely effects on surface-water stages and flows, hydroperiod, and groundwater levels and salinity in south Florida of (1) a vertical Biscayne aquifer barrier to maintain higher wetland levels, (2) possible future changes to current water-management practices, and (3) sea-level rise. The BISECT model is a combination of the Tides and Inflows to the Mangrove Everglades (TIME) and Biscayne models of the western and eastern parts of south Florida including Everglades National Park, the southern Miami-Dade urban area, and the Biscayne Bay coast and simulates hydrodynamic surface-water flow and three-dimensional groundwater conditions dynamically for the period 1996–2004 by using the Flow and Transport in a Linked Overland/Aquifer Density-Dependent System (FTLOADDS) simulator. BISECT includes a number of parameter and algorithmic refinements that improve simulation results relative to the TIME and Biscayne models and represents the hydrologic system more explicitly, including (1) improved topographic representations, (2) refined Manning’s friction coefficients, (3) improved evapotranspiration computation through spatially variable albedo, (4) increased vertical aquifer discretization, and (5) extension of the western boundary farther offshore.Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that simulated flows into Long Sound have a different pattern of response to tidal amplitude, wind, and frictional resistance changes than do other coastal streams in the model; flows at Broad River and Lostmans River are most sensitive to tidal amplitude, wind, and frictional resistance changes; and flow to the Everglades coastal streams is substantially affected by surface-water/groundwater interactions in the eastern urban areas. Insight into the hydrologic system came from scenario simulations that represent proposed management actions, such as grouting of the aquifer to prevent seepage from the wetlands and changes to water deliveries proposed by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), and projected sea-level rise. These scenario management changes are considered separately to isolate their specific effects and also in conjunction with sea-level rise. Scenario simulations show that (1) attempts to prevent seepage from the wetlands by grouting the aquifer along the L 31N levee produce minimal effects on surface-water levels; (2) the increased water deliveries proposed in the CERP redistribute flow to the northwestern coastal part of the study area with a minimal reduction to the southeast and a more substantial reduction in flows in the intervening coastal zones, mitigating some sea-level rise effects; (3) sea-level rise has a larger effect on the hydrology (water levels, flow, and salinity) than does CERP restoration; and (4) support for ecological models and hydrologic studies can be provided by applying BISECT to scenarios influenced by climatic and anthropogenic changes or by meteorological variability, such as extreme wet or dry periods.',\n",

    "### A note about formal, standardized metadata\n",
    "I can imagine a question coming up about why we would not pursue tying in formal, structured metadata where it exists into this process, hitting things like FGDC CSDGM records and using the more robust metadata there in this process. It's a valid question and would be worth pursuing. The reasons I did not address that yet in this exploration include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The web links that are often found, provided, and included so far in our exploratory work usually go to some type of information landing page meant for human consumption. It often takes some additional sleuthing or web scraping or other means to discover a link to a formal metadata record. Interpretive conventions could be applied in our case here to make assumptions that a \"catalog.data.gov\" link is going to have a formal metadata record, and with a little rewriting in the URL or further API search, we might find it to exploit. However, I'd argue that the best thing to do is for those catalog systems to put all of that metadata content right into one form or the other of landing page embedded structured metadata that can be read by processes like this as well as by humans.\n",
    "* For right now, we really don't need all that much metadata content to make our model items quite a bit better. Limiting to what we might get through this kind of process keeps things simple and focuses on the highest level metadata elements that we probably care most about at the moment.\n",
    "* The harder issues to work through have to do with the substance of the content and whether or not it adds value in this context. Context in which metadata are produced matters immensely in many cases. Metadata produced in a FGDC CSDGM record for releasing a product is done for one purpose while metadata put into a advertisement page for that product online may be quite different. At this stage, the metadata advertising the product is probably the most useful context for our immediate purposes."
