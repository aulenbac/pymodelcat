### Overview of the U.S. Geological Survey Model Catalog Project
The U.S. Geological Survey Model Catalog Project (USGS-MCP) incorporates an experimental approach for identifying and featuring scientific models developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other scientific models developed by external organizations used in USGS investigations. 

The USGS-MCP strives to achieve three primary goals:

1. Improve discovery and awareness of scientific models
2. Develop mechanisms to link scientific models to supplementary information, including professional contacts, reference literature, web resources, source code, data, and documented model applications 
3. Facilitate traceability and reproducibility of model results and model-based (e.g. decision) support tools.

The USGS-MCP leverages existing components of data management and web infrastructure across the USGS. The model catalog remains in development. Work has begun using a limited number of data sources and information associated with models, assigned with USGS Digital Object Identifiers. We are currently developing a prototype user interface, referred to as the 'USGS Model Catalog', within the [ScienceBase](http://sciencebase.gov/) infrastructure to manually explore available data and other relevant information. 

The project is led by [Core Science Systems Mission Area](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/core-science-systems), [Science Analytics and Synthesis Program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/about), Science Data Management Branch. For more information, please see our [Contributions information](/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Disclaimers
- The USGS model catalog is strictly a __catalog of model information__. Items in this catalog will provide links to model archives and other relevant content rather than storing copies of information directly within the catalog. 
- There are operational model archives more comprehensive and robust than the described model catalog prototype. The focus herein is to determine how USGS can better document model information and ultimately contribute to related projects developed by the scientific community at large.
