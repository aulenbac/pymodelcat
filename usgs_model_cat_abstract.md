### Overview of the U.S. Geological Survey Model Catalog Project
The U.S. Geological Survey Model Catalog Project (USGS-MCP) uses an experimental approach for identifying and featuring scientific models developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and those developed externally used in USGS investigations. 

The USGS-MCP strives to achieve three primary goals:

1. Improve discovery and awareness of scientific models
2. Develop mechanisms to link scientific models to supplementary information, including professional contacts, reference literature, web resources, source code, data, and model applications 
3. Facilitate traceability and reproducibility of model results and model-based (e.g. decision) support tools.

The USGS-MCP leverages existing components of data management and web infrastructure across the USGS. We are currently developing a prototype user interface within the [ScienceBase](http://sciencebase.gov/) infrastructure for manually exploring available data and associated content, referred to throughout the documentation as 'USGS Model Catalog'. 

The project is led by [Core Science Systems Mission Area](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/core-science-systems), [Science Analytics and Synthesis Program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/about), Science Data Management Branch. For more information, please see our [Contributions information](/contributions.md).


### Disclaimers
- The USGS model catalog is strictly a __catalog of model information__. Items in this catalog will provide links to model archives and other relevant content rather than storing copies of information directly within the catalog. 
- In terms of status, the model catalog remains in development. Work has begun using a limited number of data sources and information associated with models, assigned with USGS Digital Object Identifiers. 
- There are operational model archives more comprehensive and robust than the described model catalog prototype. The focus herein is to determine how USGS can better document model information and ultimately contribute to related projects developed by the scientific community at large.
